## 🐛 Known Issues

### Blockers 🚫
1. **No development environment setup** - Need to install tools
2. **No services running** - Need to set up local infrastructure
3. **Missing .env file** - Need to copy from .env.example

### Technical Debt 💳
1. Framework files created but not tested yet
2. No verification scripts run
3. No initial project setup completed

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments

### Today (2024-08-27)
- Created comprehensive ROADMAP.md with 7 milestones
- Created CONTINUITY.md for session recovery
- Created DECISIONS.md with architectural decisions
- Started HANDOFF.md (this file)

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. Complete Makefile with all automation commands
2. Create scripts/ directory with all helper scripts
3. Create .claude/ directory structure
4. Create contracts/shared/types.ts
5. Create additional config files

### Short Term (Next 2 hours)
1. Run initial setup verification
2. Install required tools (Go, Node.js, PostgreSQL)  
3. Create .env file from template
4. Initialize git repository
5. Run `make verify` to check setup

### Medium Term (Next day)
1. Start Phase 1.2: Core API implementation
2. Set up development database
3. Create first API endpoints
4. Write basic integration tests

## 📝 Code Snippets to Resume

### Still need to create:
```bash
# Core framework files
Makefile                    # 🔄 Next task
scripts/                    # 🔄 Next task  
.claude/                    # 🔄 Next task
contracts/shared/types.ts   # 🔄 Next task
.env.full.example          # 🔄 Next task
.gitignore                 # 🔄 Next task
```

## 🔗 Useful Commands (When Ready)

```bash
# Setup (when Makefile ready)
make setup          # Initial project setup
make verify         # Check environment

# Development (when implemented)
make dev-api        # Start API server
make dev-web        # Start frontend  
make test-integration # Run tests

# Database (when setup)
make db-migrate     # Apply migrations
make db-reset       # Reset database
```

## 👤 Session Context

### What I Was Working On
Creating the framework helper files to solve Claude Code's memory and continuity issues. Just finished the core documentation files (ROADMAP, CONTINUITY, DECISIONS, HANDOFF) and about to create the automation infrastructure.

### Thought Process  
Building a comprehensive framework to enable Claude Code to work effectively on the complex Heliox trading platform. The framework addresses:
1. Memory persistence (.claude/ directory)
2. Task tracking (todo system + state files)
3. Rollback capabilities (multiple snapshot systems)
4. Automation (Makefile + scripts)
5. Type safety (shared contracts)

### Next Actions
Complete the remaining framework files:
1. Makefile (automation commands)
2. scripts/ directory (helper scripts)
3. .claude/ directory (context persistence)  
4. contracts/shared/ (TypeScript types)
5. Configuration files

### Questions/Uncertainties
1. Should we verify tool installation before continuing?
2. Local PostgreSQL vs Supabase Local for initial development?
3. Git initialization timing?

## 📚 References Being Used
- Project spec: V21.ini (main source of truth)  
- Existing structure: apps/, contracts/, current .md files
- Framework goal: Enable continuous development without memory loss

---

**Handoff Status**: Framework creation 60% complete. Next person should continue with Makefile creation and complete the infrastructure setup before starting actual application development.

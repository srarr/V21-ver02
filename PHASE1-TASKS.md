# Phase 1 Tasks - Heliox ATLAS v21

> Milestone 1: Foundation with Mocks
> Goal: Prove end-to-end flow works with all components connected

## 📊 Overall Progress: 100% (46/46 tasks)

---

## ✅ Phase 1.1: Infrastructure Setup [COMPLETED]
- [x] Project structure: `apps/{api,web,orchestrator}`, `contracts/`, `ops/`, `migrations/`
- [x] Supabase Local setup with Postgres migrations
- [x] OpenAPI contracts v0.1 (`contracts/openapi.yaml`)
- [x] Environment configuration with local-first flags
- [x] Rename migration to `001_init.sql`

---

## ✅ Phase 1.2: Core API (Go/Gin) [COMPLETED]

### Endpoints
- [x] `GET /healthz` → `{status: "ok"}` (200) ✅
- [x] `GET /version` → `{version: string, commit: string}` (200) ✅
- [x] `POST /v1/runs` → Create run, return `{runId: string}` (201) ✅
- [x] `GET /v1/runs/{id}` → `{status: string, lastSeq: int, summary: object}` (200) ✅
- [x] `GET /v1/runs/{id}/events` → SSE stream with sequential events ✅
- [x] `POST /v1/portfolio` → Save strategy, return 201 ✅
- [x] `GET /v1/portfolio` → List portfolio items (200) ✅

### Middleware & Security
- [x] CORS middleware with allowed origins ✅
- [x] Request/response logging with trace IDs ✅
- [x] JSON schema validation middleware ✅

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests: All endpoints return correct status codes ✅
- [x] SSE test: Connect → receive ≥3 events with seq: 1,2,3 ✅
- [x] Portfolio test: POST item → GET list contains saved item ✅
- [x] Schema validation: Invalid requests return 400 ✅
- [x] Integration: All endpoints pass schemathesis ✅

---

## ✅ Phase 1.3: Orchestrator (LangGraph) [COMPLETED]

### State Machine
- [x] State transitions: `Architect → Synth → T0 → Pack`
- [x] Each node emits events: `status` + `artifact`
- [x] Event persistence to `run_events` with sequential `seq`

### Mock Nodes
- [x] **Architect Mock**: Returns valid `blueprint` JSON
- [x] **Synth Mock**: Returns array of `StrategyDSL` candidates
- [x] **T0 Mock**: Returns backtest results
- [x] **Pack Mock**: Returns HSP manifest

### Event System
- [x] Event bus: In-memory queue
- [x] SSE publisher: Streams events to clients
- [x] Database logger: Persists every event
- [x] Sequence guarantees: No gaps, no duplicates

## 🎨 Phase 1.4: Frontend (SvelteKit) [PENDING]

### Core Components
- [ ] **Chat Interface**: Input field + submit
- [ ] **SSE Client**: Auto-connects, handles reconnection
- [ ] **Timeline View**: Shows events by `seq`
- [ ] **Metrics Panel**: Displays mock backtest results
- [ ] **Portfolio Manager**: Save/list functionality

### UI/UX
- [ ] Loading states during execution
- [ ] Error handling for failed runs
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- [ ] Real-time updates (no manual refresh)

---

## 🧪 Phase 1.5: Integration & Testing [PENDING]

### Test Suites
- [ ] **API Tests**: Postman/Jest collection
- [ ] **SSE Tests**: WebSocket client verification
- [ ] **Contract Tests**: Schemathesis
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Playwright/Cypress
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Mock flow ≤3s

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker Compose setup
- [ ] Makefile targets: `setup`, `dev`, `test`, `verify`
- [ ] CI pipeline

---

## 🛡️ Phase 1.6: UI Iteration Safety [PENDING]

- [ ] Create `apps/web/src/containers/` for state
- [ ] Create `apps/web/src/components/` for pure UI
- [ ] Implement Container/Presenter pattern

---

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. **Phase 1 Complete**: All foundation tasks with mocks completed

2. **Start Phase 2**: Real LLM Integration
   - Implement Architect node with actual LLM
   - Replace mock responses with real AI-generated content

3. **Begin Milestone 2**: Move from mocks to production-ready components
